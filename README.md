There is a bird feeder mounted to the window near my desk. As a side project I created a program using openCV and a USB camera to capture clips of when birds land and eat at the feeder.
The program looks for motion in an average of frames and sorts between videos with good and bad lighting then saves them to a directory named "bird"

Check out some of the footage I collected here: https://youtu.be/Aj74UHBin-w
